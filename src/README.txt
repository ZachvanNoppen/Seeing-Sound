The program created is a 3D journey of an object. Objects are spawned based on the drum beat. Every kick spawns a new sphere. Each sphere is sized based on the volume of the song. The background colour of the environment is changed based on the synth underlying the music.

The user is able to look at the progression through the environment by clicking with the LEFT mouse button and dragging. This rotates the camera around the player sphere.

I decided to design the project this way as it is the simplest way I could think of to show progression through a story. Being able to look back at the progress made is very rewarding and seeing the environment change is interesting.

The biggest challenge was calibrating all the inputs correctly and mapping the objects based on that input.

This project was completed with the most confidence compared to the others. I found myself overcoming problems very quickly. Whether it is due to working with sounds or the simplicity of the assignment, the problems never held me back long. Not the most rewarding program, but definitely very fun to make.

A good way to end the semester. Thanks Anthony for all the hard work you've put into our courses. It was lovely having you as a prof. Have a great holiday!
